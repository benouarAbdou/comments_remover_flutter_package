# Comments Remover

A powerful command-line tool for removing comments from Dart files in your Flutter projects. Whether you need a cleaner codebase for production, code reviews, or learning purposes, **Comments Remover** helps you strip out single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments effortlessly.

## Why Use Comments Remover?

Comments are invaluable during development for documentation and debugging, but there are cases where removing them is useful:

- **Minification**: Reduce file size for production builds, improving performance and readability.
- **Code Review**: Focus on logic and structure without distractions from comments.
- **Learning**: Clean up example projects (e.g., Flutter templates) to study core functionality without extra explanations.
- **Obfuscation**: Remove sensitive or unnecessary annotations before sharing code or submitting assignments.
