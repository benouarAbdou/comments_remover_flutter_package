# Comments Remover

A powerful command-line tool for removing comments from Dart files in your Flutter projects. Whether you need a cleaner codebase for production, code reviews, or learning purposes, **Comments Remover** helps you strip out single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments effortlessly.

## Why Use Comments Remover?

Comments are invaluable during development for documentation and debugging, but there are cases where removing them is useful:

- **Minification**: Reduce file size for production builds, improving performance and readability.
- **Code Review**: Focus on logic and structure without distractions from comments.
- **Learning**: Clean up example projects (e.g., Flutter templates) to study core functionality without extra explanations.
- **Obfuscation**: Remove sensitive or unnecessary annotations before sharing code or submitting assignments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Dart installed. You can check by running:

```sh
dart --version
```

If Dart is not installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

### Installing the Package

Install the package globally using Dart's package manager:

```sh
dart pub global activate comments_remover
```

## Usage

### Remove Comments from Dart Files

By default, `comments_remover` processes all Dart files in the `lib/` directory.

```sh
dart pub global run comments_remover
```

### Command Options

| `--path`      | Specify a target file or directory (defaults to `lib/`). |
| `--single-line` | Remove only single-line comments (`//`).              |

### Examples

1. Remove all comments from a specific file:
   
   ```sh
   dart pub global run comments_remover --path lib/main.dart
   ```

2. Remove only single-line comments from all Dart files in `lib/`:
   
   ```sh
   dart pub global run comments_remover --single-line
   ```

3. Remove only multi-line comments from a specific directory:
   
   ```sh
   dart pub global run comments_remover --path lib/src --multi-line
   ```

## Example Output

### Input File (Before):

```dart
// This is a single-line comment
void main() {
  /* This is a multi-line
     comment */
  print("Hello"); // Inline comment
}
```
